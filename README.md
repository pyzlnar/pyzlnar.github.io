# README

This is the repo for [pyzlnar.github.io](https://pyzlnar.github.io)

It's a small "_aboutme_" built in place of my previous site. \
Free hosting, and I don't have to worry about maintaining or keeping it secure. What's not to like?

### Requirements

- ruby 2+
- bundler (`gem install bundler`)

### Installation

Just run:

```bash
$ bundler install
```

### Running and Building

**Running**:

```bash
$ jekyll serve
```

**Building**:

```bash
$ jekyll build
```

### Other Notes

As of this writing, `github-pages` already has dependencies for literally every necessary gem,
including jekyll, all of it's plugins and it's templates.

It's definitely not worth installing jekyll by itself because jekyll is on v4, while github-pages
requires a specific v3 version.
