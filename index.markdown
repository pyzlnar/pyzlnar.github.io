# Hello World

Hello and welcome! \
Yes, I'm a programmer.

I'm the kind of guy that uses vim, and uses hacker templates on his github.io because they look
cool. If you're here you probably are interested in the things I've done, my ability as a programmer
and the like. You can see some of the highlights below.
